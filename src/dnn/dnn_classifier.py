Description:
Stepping beyond the tabular data within the OkCupid dataset,
we now explore the unstructured text which is given by each

Here we will explore embeddings and a Deep Neural Network
to attemp to better classify the gender of a given user
than either the Logistic Regression or TabNet model.
