Description:
This project will use the OkCupid dataset available on
Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles/) to
explore various topics within AI/ML and other data fields. 

The main goal of this project is to share exposure of Alex Mead's skills
in a more public manner as nearly all of his best work is locked behind NDAs.

To Do:
The first step involves downloading the dataset locally from Kaggle. It's 
a small dataset, so simply use the console and download the data. In 
your Downloads directory you should find a file archive.zip. Unzip this 
file and you will get a CSV named okcupid_profiles.csv. Put the archive.zip and 
okcupid_profiles.csv into the OkC_Classifier/data/ directory. This is the 
filepath expected for the scripts. Note, you will need to make the "data"
folder locally as it is included in .gitignore so the dataset isn't pushed
to the remote repo.

Notes:
1) All code uses Python version 3.10.8
2) This is a demo-project, all code is free to use in anyway, see MIT license. 
3) This is a "rough and dirty" project. Many other aspects must be considered
    when building in production environments or on teams to foster team
    producitively (e.g. linting, proper comments).
