Description:
This project will use the OkCupid dataset available on
Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles/) to
explore various topics within AI/ML and other data fields. 

The main goal of this project is to share exposure of Alex Mead's skills
in a more public manner as nearly all of his best work is locked behind NDAs.

To Do:
The first step involves downloading the dataset locally from Kaggle. It's 
a small dataset, so simply using the console and download the data. In 
your Downloads directory you should find a file archive.zip. Unzip this 
file and you will get a CSV named okcupid_profiles.csv. Put the archive.zip and 
okcupid_profiles.csv into the OkC_Classifier/data/ directory. This is the 
filepath expected for the scripts.


Projects:
1) Build a data set pre-processor:
    The goal of the project is get familiar with the dataset as well as to
    clean up the various rows for more traditional data science type work.
